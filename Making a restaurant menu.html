      <h3 style ="color:darkblue;">Nigerian jollof rice</h3>
      
      <p style="color:rebeccapurple;">ingredients. </p>
      <p>.Because Jollof Rice is Bae, and much loved South of the Sahara and along the coast of West Africa.</p>

<p style="color:aqua;">Spiced and stewed in a flavorful tomato broth, it is everything from "everyday" to celebration. The classic version is cooked with long-grain rice (Uncle Ben's/Carolina's) and seasoned with Nigerian-style curry powder and dried thyme. Served with fried, ripe plantains which we call dodo and coleslaw, it is everything. Note that the world might consider this a side but in Nigeria, it is the main. :)</p>

<p style="color:bisque;">Even more special is Party Rice, a smoky version, cooked over an open fire, layered with smoke, spice, and immeasurable goodness. A few years ago, I cracked the code on approximating the smoky flavor on the stovetop. The secret?.</p>

<p style="color:revert;">Learning to make Jollof was a rite of passage for me and I've gone through so many iterations each time trying to streamline the process while delivering the most flavour.</p>

<h4>Some notes:</h4>
<p>- This makes a large pot but you can successfully halve this recipe</p>
<p>- If you're using thinner long grain rice like basmati rice or scented rice
 use less stock:
<list>
  <ol>
  <li>so 3 - 4 cups not 5 - 6; </li>
  <li> less tomato sauce - say 1/2 - 2/3rds.</li>
</ol>
</list>
  <p> Leave the tomato puree as is and slightly adjust the spices<br>
- When you add the rice in Step 4, trust the process<br> - leave it to steam without fretting. Trust me, it'll be fine<br>
- Leftovers keep well too></p>

<h3>TEST KITCHEN NOTES</h3>
<p style="color:inherit;">Ozoz Sokoh, aka Kitchen Butterfly, is a Nigerian food explorer, blogger, culinary anthropologist, and food historian—she’s also a longtime Food52 community member and contributor of many beloved recipes. In fact, it’s her we have to thank for sharing one of our all-time most popular dishes: Classic Nigerian Jollof Rice.</p>

<p><b>“The thing about Jollof...it’s that one dish across West Africa that is a unifying dish,” Ozoz told our co-founder Merrill Stubbs in a recent episode of ‘At Home With Us.’ Every country has their own version, she explains, “But the core is always two things—well, three things: rice, a tomato stew, and seasoning.”</b></p>

<p><i>Thousands of people have made this recipe since Ozoz put it up on the site in 2016. She’s revisited it to make a few key changes that are slightly different from what you’ll see in the video.</i></p>

<p style="color:deepskyblue;">In the original recipe, the method instructs you to first parboil the rice in stock, but it can sometimes lead to overcooked rice. Ozoz now skips that step and adds the stock in with the tomato and pepper mixture, adding the rice in raw. She also calls for 1/2 to 1 Scotch Bonnet pepper (instead of the full 1) now.</p>

<p style="color:goldenrod;">Another tweak to the ingredients list: Ozoz uses both white and black pepper for a deeper, earthier, smokier flavor. Oh, and one last thing: If you want to make your curry powder blend from scratch, this Nigerian-style version from Ozoz is the way to go.</p>

      <img src="ugali.jpg" width="420" height="420">
      <p style="color:revert;">ingredients.</p>

      <h1 style="color:indianred;">INGREDIENTS<h1><br>
  
   (a) 1 Kg cooking flour<br>
   (b) 8 cups water</p>
<h1 style="color:palevioletred;">INSTRUCTIONS</h1><br>
 
<p>First, switch on your stove to high. Using a medium-sized and deep pot, bring water to boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and set ½ a cup of water aside.</p>
<p>To the pot, add the maize flour (cornmeal), a quarter of a cup at a time, and use a wooden spoon to stir, using circular motions. At this point, it should be slightly thick and resemble porridge.</p>
<p>Continue adding the maize flour (cornmeal) a little at a time, and stirring until all of it has been used up and the mixture is firm. This will take about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Using the wooden spoon, poke small holes on the surface of the ugali and add the previously preserved hot water to the holes.</p> 
<p> Next, cover and allow to cook for a further 5 minutes stirring halfway through, or until all the water has evaporated and the bottom of the pan is browned up but not burning.</p>
<p>Use the wooden spoon to transfer the ugali to the side of the pot. You will know the ugali is cooked when it easily pulls away from the bottom of the pot and starts to give a strong corn aroma. A small ball pinched between the thumbs will also feel slightly sticky and not grainy.</p>
<p>Finally, run the wooden spoon under tap water (this helps with the shaping). Shape the ugali in the pot until you have</p> something that resembles a round ball.
<p>Take the pot from the stove and tip it upside down onto a plate, so the ugali now falls to the plate. You can shape it again using a wooden stick. Serve ugali while hot with Kachumbari, nyama choma, sukuma wiki, or your favourite dishes.</p>

      <H1>How to roast a Chicken</H1>
<P>Roasting a whole chicken at home is easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</P>

<h3>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h3><br>
<p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken recipe of your life:</p><br>

<b>1· Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.<br>
2· Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.<br>
3· Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.<br>
4· Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.<br></b>

<h1 style="color:aquamarine;">How to Roast a Chicken Step-By-Step</h1><br>
<p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade roasted chicken:</p>
<list>
  <ol> 
<li> Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
<li> Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
<li>Stuff the cavity with celery.</li>
<li> Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
</ol>
</list><br>
<h1 style="color:darkred;">How Long to Roast a Chicken</h1>
<p> In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, a 3-pound whole chicken should be completely cooked in a little more than an hour.</p> 
<p><b>You'll know it's done when the meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (near the bone) reads 165 degrees F.</b></p>
